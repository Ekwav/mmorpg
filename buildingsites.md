## Placing of building sites:

* To place a building site, a shovel is required.
* You have to select one vertexpoint.
* It starts from this point and expand to the right and front of the looking direction of the player.
* The high of the building site ground will be adapted to the high of the one selected vertexpoint.
* The time it will takes to flatt the building site can be accelerated by gold.
* The price of the building site depends on the size.
