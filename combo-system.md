The standard combat is just like in other games, the player gets 3 buttons to press to make different attacks. Wich will do the attack in the direction he is looking in.
The secondary combat system allows special keyboard and movement (for mobile) combos wich are more effective.
Furthermore all spells are available at all times with the secondary attack system, instead of just 3.


### Example
* `fireSpell` -> `f+v+r+g` or `left,right,tap,up`
